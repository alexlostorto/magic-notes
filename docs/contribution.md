_22/07/23_: I published the **source code** [**here**](../console/console.js) and refactored it so it is **maintainable**.

_18/07/23_: I was notified of Sparx **redesigning** their website. Due to this change, the extension will **not be compatible** with the new website and therefore become unusable in the near future. It is for this reason that I will release the source code and add as much documentation as possible, so that others can modify the code and hopefully **continue the legacy!**
