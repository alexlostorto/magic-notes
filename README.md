<h1 align="center">Magic Notes</h1>

Welcome to **Magic Notes**, an extension designed to make learning on Sparx Maths more **fun**! Please read the **terms and conditions** [**here**](T&C.txt) before using the extension.

When I first started using Sparx Maths, I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of question styles that were offered and the automatic level system which allowed each individual to learn at their own pace. This is why I created this program in the hopes of motivating students to use Sparx Maths and in turn, develop an innate passion for learning Maths on their website.

> **Note** This program has no connection with Sparx Maths. Sparx Maths is owned by Sparx LTD.
