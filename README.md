Welcome to **Magic Notes**! Please read the **terms and conditions** [**here**](T&C.txt) before using the extension.

When I first started using Sparx Maths, I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of question styles that were offered and the automatic level system which allowed each individual to learn at their own pace. This is why I created this program in the hopes of motivating students to use Sparx Maths and in turn, develop an innate passion for learning Maths on their website.

Click [**here**](https://alexlostorto.github.io/magic-notes/) to visit the **Magic Notes** website and copy the code.

> **Note** This program has no connection with Sparx Maths. Sparx Maths is owned by Sparx LTD.

## üôã FAQ

#### Q. Do I have to copy and paste the code every time?

A. If you want the program to stay permanently instead of manually injecting it, install it [here](https://alexlostorto.github.io/magic-notes/install/index.html).

#### Q. Why is more than one answer highlighted?

A. Unfortunately, the answer detection system isn't perfect. The answer is displayed above the bookwork check so you can use your judgement to make an appropriate decision.

#### Q. Can I suggest a colour theme?

A. Yes of course! If you have a colour theme that isn't already in the [available themes](./docs/themes.md) then send me an email or create an Issue [here](https://github.com/alexlostorto/magic-notes/issues/new)

> **Note** Colour themes have 4 different colours: lightest, light, dark, darkest. Colours will look different when used on the Sparx Maths website.
